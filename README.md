# Grammy and The Recording Academy Web Analysis

In this github repository, I posted my mini project that I did over the summer. I've got the data from one of my courses in University of Colorado Denver and I was interested in finding out more about this dataset. So, I did some data cleaning, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, summary and insights & recommendations in this file. In addition, I also uploaded the .csv files that I used for this analysis. 

RECOMMENDATION: I did this project on Jupyter notebook, so I recommend to run this project on Jupyter notebook or Google colab.

UPDATE: I added a pdf file version of this project, you do not need Jupyter Notebook, instead you can download the pdf file and read it from there. However, if you wish to edit the file, please download the `.ipynb` version.

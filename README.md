# Grammy and The Recording Academy Web Analysis

In this github repository, I posted my mini project that I did over the summer. I've got the data from one of my courses in University of Colorado Denver and I was interested in finding out more about this dataset. So, I did some data cleaning, data preparation, exploratory data analysis, summary and insights & recommendations in this file. In addition, I also uploaded the .csv files that I used for this analysis. 

RECOMMENDATION: I did this project on Jupyter notebook, so I recommend to run this project on Jupyter notebook or Google colab.
